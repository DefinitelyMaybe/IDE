# IDE
Work in progress. Ideas change.

This is an attempt to create an web interface for which anyone can work on their ideas/models.

Background:
It started back in a university maths course which dealt with matrices. The main issue I had when trying to use MATLAB or other web tools was their interfaces. You've either got a search box or you're comfortable with the command line. Creating a solution for developing more generally is the goal.
