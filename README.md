# Math-IDE
Work in progress. Ideas change.

Currently the main goal of this to flesh out the basic's of the idea.
This includes:
-Interactions/interface within the browser and...
-Server side computation

This is the first and most previlent distingtion. Client's browser can handle some calculations however the further into maths this goes the less appropriate the browser becomes. It's important to note that the other option would be to develop the program as an application to install. My thoughts towards this are currently that taking the browser approach boardens this "tools" availibility.

=================================================================================================
Stage 1 - The Browser

Part 1 - The Interface
What is the default settings?
-background, values, assumptions, notation, ...
What settings are available for the user to change?
-Colours, size, shortcuts, zoom, ... 
Data structures created by javascript.
(The representations are important because they need to be small in size and instantly deliverable IF they are required for server-side computation)
-functions, graphs, tables, vectors, matrices, ...

Stage 2 - The Server

Part 1 - Send and Recieve
Part 2 - Math
