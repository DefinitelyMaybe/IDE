# IDE
Work in progress. Ideas change.

This is an attempt to create a thing for someone to work on their maths and easily translate that maths into code for use.

# Background
It started back in a university maths course which dealt with matrices. The main issue I had when trying to use MATLAB or other web tools was their interfaces. You've either got a search box or you're comfortable with the command line. There was this one website which I liked but that functionally speaking was a simple one-time calculator. Seeing the matrix was better than thinking about it and having it float in memory somewhere. Creating a solution for developing more generally is the goal. Lets see how far we get.
