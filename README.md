# IDE
Work in progress. Ideas change.

This is an attempt to create an interface for which someone can work on their ideas.

It started back in maths 208 with matrices but creating a solution for developing more generally is
the goal.

Sticking with maths for the moment, current interfaces that I know of are simply a search
box or have very limited interactivity.
