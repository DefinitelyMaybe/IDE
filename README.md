# turnt-sansa
Work in progress.

Currently the main goal of this to flesh out the basic's of my idea.
This includes:
-Creating a function object
	(Nothing past simple arithmetic at this point.)
-Displaying the function object in a reasonable maner
	(Zooming with mouse wheel can come later.)
-Giving a small amount of interactions with the function object within the initial space.
	(Re-locating the function object, changing values within the function.
	Later on, outputs to inputs.)

Helpful hints:
JQuery - keypress()
html - button, text area, canvas

From the wall:
-Draw shapes
-Draw graphs
-Writing / comments
-compute / solve / re-arrange (make x the subject)
-customisability (setting up defaults and looks)
-import & export of the workspace (sharing whatever people make with this.)
-plugins (giving people the ability to extend it's capibilities)
