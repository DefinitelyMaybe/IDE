# IDE
Work in progress. Ideas change.

This is an attempt to create an website for someone to work on their models/maths with an interface usable by more than just programmers.

Background: It started back in a university maths course which dealt with matrices. The main issue I had when trying to use MATLAB or other web tools was their interfaces. You've either got a search box or you're comfortable with the command line. There was this one website which I liked but that functionally speaking was a simple one-time calculator. Creating a solution for developing more generally is the goal.

Up Next:
1-intro to file system (storing graphs)
2-intro to GUI (basic view/rendering + user clicks & node location)
3-defining/exploring
  -matrices & vectors
  -variables vs values
  -functions and graphs
4-convert to code
